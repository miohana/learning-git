# Learning Git
The purpose of this repository is to practice git commands using the command line and it's basic instructions.
This training was proposed to the **Nerfherders** team, a community that loves the open source world and knowledge sharing.

## How it is done?
To practice, I will use as an example a part of the content learned from the [JavaScript Templating with Handlebars](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/handlebars-javascript-templating) course I did on the [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) platform, about a relation of _Node.js_ and _Handlebars_ that I found very interesting! :tada:
